mtp (0.0.1+13.10.20130913-0ubuntu2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * fix property handling so existing property settings are respected and mtp
    is only added/removed to/from the set
  * make sure we disable mtp on the usb gadget driver during shutdown so gvfsd
    on the host doesnt spill errors when the phone is rebooted because there is
    a mtp device but no server attached to it (LP: #1226825).
